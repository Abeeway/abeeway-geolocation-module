 * \brief BLE scan service
 *
 * \details This service performs BLE beacon scans.<BR>
 *
 * \warning Before using this service, the BLE driver should be opened as observer only or observer and peripheral.

 * <BR>
 *
 * <H3>Service usage</H3>
 * <DIV>
 * Basically the service performs a beacon scan based on filters. Once the scan is done, a user callback is triggered
 * with the result and a report.<BR>
 * Both the result and the reports contain the list of observed beacons matching the filtering criteria. The difference
 * comes from the provided data:
 * <UL>
 *  <LI>
 *   The result handles the information contained in the beacon advertisement part according to the beacon type.
 *  </LI>
 *  <LI>
 *   The report contains only information requested by the user. For example, the user can be interested by the beacon identifiers<BR>
 *   (carried inside the advertised data) instead of the MAC addresses.<BR>
 *   Refer to the srv_ble_scan_report_type_t structure for more details.
 *  </LI>
 * </UL>
 * The scan operation is started via the call to the srv_ble_scan_start function, for which a user callback should be provided.<BR>
 * The user argument is optional.<BR>
 * The scan operation can be aborted at any time by calling the function srv_ble_scan_stop.<BR>
 * </DIV>
 *
 * <H3>Filtering</H3>
 * <DIV>
 * Before starting a scan, it is recommended to configure it. This is done by calling the function srv_ble_scan_get_params and modify the parameters. <BR>
 * SRV uses an enhanced filtering scheme depending on the beacons type to filter. The beacon type, listed by the enumerated srv_ble_scan_beacon_type_t, can be:
 * <UL>
 *  <LI>
 *    srv_ble_scan_beacon_type_all: All beacon types are accepted. The filters cannot be applied and the report can handle only MAC addresses.
 *  </LI>
 *  <LI>
 *   srv_ble_scan_beacon_type_eddy_uid: Only Eddystone UUID beacons are accepted. The filters can be applied and the report can handle any type of information (beacon identifier or MAC addresses)
 *  </LI>
 *  <LI>
 *   srv_ble_scan_beacon_type_eddy_url: Only Eddystone URL beacons are accepted. The filters can be applied and the report can handle any type of information (beacon identifier or MAC addresses)
 *  </LI>
 *  <LI>
 *   srv_ble_scan_beacon_type_eddy_all: All Eddystone beacons (UUID/URL/TLM/EID) are accepted. The filters cannot be applied and the report can handle only MAC addresses.
 *  </LI>
 *  <LI>
 *   srv_ble_scan_beacon_type_ibeacon: Only iBeacons are accepted. The filters can be applied and the report can handle any type of information (beacon identifier or MAC addresses)
 *  </LI>
 *  <LI>
 *   srv_ble_scan_beacon_type_altbeacon: Only altBeacons are accepted. The filters can be applied and the report can handle any type of information (beacon identifier or MAC addresses)
 *  </LI>
 *  <LI>
 *   srv_ble_scan_beacon_type_custom: The filters must be configured. Beacons matching the filter are accepted. The report can handle any type of information (beacon identifier or MAC addresses)
 *  </LI>
 *  <LI>
 *   srv_ble_scan_beacon_type_exposure: Only exposure advertisements are accepted. The filters cannot be applied and the report can handle only MAC addresses.
 *  </LI>
 * </UL>
 * The scan configuration contains two filters. Each filter contains a 10 bytes mask and value. It also defines a start offset from which the filter should applied.<BR>
 * The filtering principle is straight forward: The filter mask is applied (logical AND) on the advertised data and compared to the value.<BR>
 * If the filter matches (comparison success), the beacon is kept otherwise it is discarded.<BR>
 * The start offset is the offset starting from the beginning of the advertisement data part.
 * </DIV>
 *
 * <H3>Result vs report</H3>
 * <DIV>
 * Once the scan is done, two structures are provided. Both contains beacons entries stored after filtering:
 * <UL>
 *  <LI>
 *  srv_ble_scan_result_t: Each entry contains the full beacon information. The entry format is based on the beacon type. The structure content is fixed and cannot be tuned.
 *  </LI>
 *  <LI>
 *  srv_ble_scan_report_t: Each entry contains the relevant part of the beacon information. It is customizable via the srv_ble_scan_param_report_t structure. <BR>
 *  you can decide about the number of entry you want and the type of identifier:
 *  <UL>
 *   <LI>
 *    srv_ble_scan_report_type_mac_address: The entries contain the MAC address in the identifier field. The short form is used in this case and the start_o
 *   </LI>
 *   <LI>
 *   srv_ble_scan_report_type_short_id: The identifier field of an entry contains 6 bytes starting from the configured start_id_offset.
 *   </LI>
 *   <LI>
 *   srv_ble_scan_report_type_long_id: The identifier field of an entry contains 16 bytes starting from the configured start_id_offset.<BR>
 *   Such a type is usually configured to do BLE finger printing.
 *   </LI>
 *  </UL>
 *  </LI>
 * </UL>
 * Note that the start_id_offset does not start from the beginning of the advertisement frame. Instead it is related to the type of beacons:
 * <UL>
 *  <LI>
 *  Eddystone beacons: start_id_offset = 0 locates the data part of the advertisement frame.
 *  </LI>
 *  <LI>
 *  iBeacons: start_id_offset = 0 locates the manufacturing UUID field of the advertisement frame.
 *  </LI>
 *  <LI>
 *  altBeacons: start_id_offset = 0 locates the beacon ID field of the advertisement frame.
 *  </LI>
 *  <LI>
 *  exposure: start_id_offset = 0 locates the RPI field of the advertisement frame.
 *  </LI>
 *  <LI>
 *  custom: start_id_offset = 0 locates the beginning of the advertisement frame.
 *  </LI>
 * </UL>
 * </DIV>
 *
 * <H3>Scan configuration</H3>
 * <DIV>
 * The scan is configured using the structure srv_ble_scan_param_t. This structure should be retrieved and manipulated before starting a scan.<BR>
 * It is strongly discouraged to change the structure while a scan is in progress. <BR>
 * The overall scan duration is configured via the scan_duration parameter. At the end of this duration, the user callback will be triggered.<BR>
 * The scan_window and scan_interval reflects the standard BLE parameters:
 * <UL>
 *  <LI>
 *   The window defines the actual scan duration for a given channel.
 *  </LI>
 *  <LI>
 *   The interval defines the actual scan duration for given channel and the delay to switch to the next channel. It is always greater than window.
 *  </LI>
 * </UL>
 * The repeat_delay parameter defines the period of complete scans. If the user expects a single scan, this parameter should be set to 0.<BR>
 * If the user expects periodic scans, this parameter should contains the period (delay between each scans).<BR>
 * The configuration structure contains the filter, the report parameters and the type of beacons we consider.<BR>
 * The field rssi_threshold provides an extra filtering based on the RSSI level. Beacons with a RSSI below this threshold are discarded.<BR>
 * Finally, the configuration a fine tuning of the advertised channels via the parameter adv_compensation. It may be used in the case where the<BR>
 * BLE antenna has not the same gain on all advertisement channel frequencies.
 * </DIV>
