 * \brief   Non-volatile memory interface API.
 *
 * \details This module provides an interface to the non-volatile memory provided
 *          by AOS for application use.
 *
 * \note    Write operations should be limited to the strict minimum to avoid
 *          deteriorating the underlying storage medium, notably FLASH memory
 *          which is only guaranteed for 10000 erase/write cycles.
