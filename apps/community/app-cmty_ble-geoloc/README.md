Develop an application FW with the Evaluation kit to scan eddystone BLE beacons with a defined 
signature set by MAIN 1 and MAIN2 parameters at a periodic and programmable time. 
Then the information collected (MAC address + RSSI)  are reported via LoRa. The format should be 
the same as the application AT2
Once this demo is working on the EVK, try to port it on the compact tracker pcb  with module (boar ABW006W1.0).
