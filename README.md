# Abeeway Type1WL Geolocation Module Evaluation Kit (EVK)

**VERSION: v1.1-0** (Latest) -> [back to master branch](https://github.com/Abeeway/abeeway-geolocation-module)

## Introduction

The Type1WL Evaluation Kit includes the following components:

- Type1WL Evaluation Board - version V2.4
- Abeeway Operating System Software Development Kit (AOS-SDK)
- The source codes of Example Applications

The following chapters explain how to start software development on the Type1WL module with the help of the EVK.

## Set up the Development Environment

1. Install [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) on your computer
2. Clone this repository and checkout the `aos-sdk_v1.1-0` branch:  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abeeway/abeeway-geolocation-module.git`
   git checkout aos-sdk_v1.1-0
   ```

3. Start the STM32CubeIDE and select the cloned repo as the workspace directory
4. Import the project into STM32CubeIDE
   - Click on the **_File > Import > General > Existing Project Into Workspace_** menu item
   - Select the following folder of the cloned repo: `abeeway-geolocation-module/apps/abeeway-demo`

## Compile the demo apps and install one of them on the Module

1. Open the `abeeway-demo` folder in the Project Explorer and select the `demo1` project
2. Compile the code by clicking on the **_Project > Build Project_** menu item.
3. Connect the Evaluation Board to your computer with an USB cable through USB_3 port.
4. Write the compiled firmware to the Abeeway Geolocation Module through the module's built-in ST-Link debugger by clicking on the **_Run > Run_** menu item. The compiled binary files are in \abeeway-geolocation-module\apps\abeeway-demo\demo1\demo1-evk-debug\demo1-evk-debug.bin. You can also flash the binary file using STM32Cube programmer or the Abeeway bootlloader. Please follow the instructions here, TBD...
5. After the download has been finished and the device restarted check if LED_3 is blinking.
6. Use a Serial Terminal tool (e.g.: minicom (on Linux), TeraTerm or Putty (on Windows), etc.) to connect your computer to the board and see the command line interface.
   - The serial port must be set to 57600 bauds, 8 data bits, no parity, one stop bit (8N1).
   - The login pin is either `123` or `456`, The former provides normal user access, the latter provides super-user access, making different sets of CLI commands available.
   - Use the `help` command to see the available command/parameter options. Commands may be abbreviated as long as they remain unambiguous.
7. Optionally, you may repeat the above steps with the `demo2` and `demo3` projects too. (Please note that LED_3 blinks only in case of the `demo1` app.)

## Read the detailed user guide and study the source code

1. Read the [AOS User Guide](https://github.com/Abeeway/abeeway-geolocation-module/tree/aos-sdk_v1.1-0/docs/AOS_user_guide.pdf)
2. Study the source code of the apps by having a look at the `README.md` and `src/main.c` files of the appropriate project.
   - [demo1/README.md](https://github.com/Abeeway/abeeway-geolocation-module/tree/aos-sdk_v1.1-0/apps/abeeway-demo/demo1/README.md),
   - [demo2/README.md](https://github.com/Abeeway/abeeway-geolocation-module/tree/aos-sdk_v1.1-0/apps/abeeway-demo/demo2/README.md),
   - [demo3/README.md](https://github.com/Abeeway/abeeway-geolocation-module/tree/aos-sdk_v1.1-0/apps/abeeway-demo/demo3/README.md)
3. Study the auto-generated API documentation of the aos-sdk in the [aos-sdk/docs/html](https://github.com/Abeeway/abeeway-geolocation-module/tree/aos-sdk_v1.1-0/aos-sdk/docs/html) folder. After you cloned this repository, you can open the [`index.html`](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Abeeway/abeeway-geolocation-module/blob/aos-sdk_v1.1-0/aos-sdk/docs/html/index.html) file with your favorite web browser to start reading.
